    "ways to get more immediate information about the people in their districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn't until the 1990s, however, that plans to get more frequent Census-type data came to fruition. Congress, seeing a drop in\n",
    "Census response rates as a result of its burdensome length, directed the U.S. Census Bureau to develop different ways to get the\n",
